- Seminar (병현)
    - Automated Repair of Layout Cross Browser Issues Using Seach-Based Techniques
- Seminar on NN optimization

- Rehearsal 정주

== Blocking Points ==
- Instrumenting `is`
    - Does it make sense? because it's testing UID
- Is TypeError a real bug or are we using the wrong type?
- TypeError during type AVM
    - redo all branches?
{{{python
def test(a):
    if a:
        a + 1
}}}
- Using floats instead of ints means that we need a way to have exact values for floats

- started to throw ideas for the report

- add exception to `__getitem__` and `__setitem__` for parameters that implement them
    - need to be subclassable

- Growing a parameter is different between a string, a list, a tuple, a dict.... But they all have similar `IndexError`

- relations between parameters, (e.g. we're removing types that don't have `__iter__` if the error says the parameter is
  not subscriptable but in reality it could be a parameter that is applying this index to the other parameter...)


== Planned work ==
- [.] Instrument Python code
    - [ ] Other comparators handled: Is | ~~IsNot~~ | In | ~~NotIn~~
        - does instrumenting `is` makes sense for other than `None`?
        - no distance for `is` or `in`
    - [ ] Other boolean like `__notzero__`
    - [ ] add distance for: "iterator | simple `if` on wether a `StopIteration` is raised, no distance"

- [.] Convert the global tool for Python
    - [ ] find a better way for `Process` sandbox, a virgin process is enough but maybe not possible because of shared
          queue
    - [ ] divide at some point for `float`
        - or see it the other way around, use `int` only and then divide if needed
    - [o] lists
        - [X] param indexing with depth
        - [X] recursive search
        - [ ] implement it in the type search
        - assumes there is a first element
            - in the search, try there for the empty list?
            - [ ] manage the case of empty list
        - [ ] handle slices
        - [ ] direction of growth
    - [X] changed from passing around the elem to passing around the index, but now I can't access elements in lists
        - [X] use a tuple of indexes
        - [X] subclass of `list` for individual.vector to accept tuple of indexes
    - [ ] positive integers

- [.] AVM to find correct type of python function
    - [X] Make it possible for cavm to execute the python function
    - [ ] More than just types, e.g. a negative integer
    - [ ] primitive types: ~~*bool*~~, numeric (~~*int*~~, ~~*float*~~, complex), iterator, sequence (*list*, tuple, range), ~~*str*~~, binary
          sequence (bytes, bytearray, memoryview), set (set, frozenset), dict, context manager
          other built-in types: modules, classes, functions, methods, ...
        - ignore 'Truth Value Testing'?
        - keep a list of tested types for each param?
    - [ ] Get information from TypeError
    - [ ] Floats seem to stay between 0 and 1
    - [ ] try False and True to avoid problems with e.g. empty list
    - [ ] try [] and with an element to know the type of the list, for now we'll put always the same type in lists
        - an error can occur after because of the size being too small
    - [ ] `TypeError` detection after
    - [ ] ~~method decorator to detect which parameter is at cause~~

- [ ] Read the code of RuTeG

- [ ] Static analysis of dynamically typed languages

- [ ] Instrument subscriptable objects accesses to know when we are approaching
    - instrument (try/except through decorator) + mock (index)
- [X] Get info to delete types that don't fit
    - still the problem of knowing wich parameter is at cause
    - do things at random
- [o] Type changes in AVM too
    - [X] type changes in `search`
        - [X] catch exceptions and change parameters
        - [X] ~~redo previous branches~~
            - no because we remember what the types for previous branches
    - [X] remove `search_type`
    - [ ] keep old type if the error doesn't change

- [X] CNN seminar [[http://cs231n.github.io/optimization-1/|CNN optimization]]

- [ ] Send email to ask in which direction I should go
    - Do something completely random that works eventually, and write all the problematics that can be addressed in the
      future
    - Narrow down the problem to have a good tool
