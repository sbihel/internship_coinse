== Things Done ==
- work on pavm

- thoughts on AVM for types
    - finding type isn't a good goal because all types can fit with duck typing
    - mock objects seem to be the solution (?)
        - When do you stop in 'recursive' mock objects?
        - for each method that is missing you have to re-executing the whole function, maybe we need automatically
          laziness
            - the execution could be different if the method exists in some edge cases
        - Nothing useful in the related work
    - How do you know that a type error isn't actually a bug?
        - if every type generates it?
        - what is 'every type'?
        - with mock objects you can implement it and miss the bug
        - what if the function is supposed to raise a TypeError in some cases?
    - try every possible combination of types?
        - no that's stupid we're doing AVM
    - one AVM for types then one AVM for values? doesn't seem possible
- Integrated a random choice of type in the AVM
    - type is changed only when there is a `TypeError`
    - has a list of supported/usable types
    - AVM for types
        - if the error message changes, change variable
        - might have a `TypeError` later on because `if False:` instead of `if 0:`

- Can we write something for small programs, have a list of all possible types and try them

- Maybe it could be interesting to use complex structures/types only when there are annotations
    - (I think I've read that having lots of classes is a code smell, so annotating complex parameters isn't a big
      overhead?)

- Discussion with Shin Yoo
    - focus on primitives and lists (with multiple types)

- Started a skeletal of report

- What about class decorators for parameters to allow some sort of lazyness or dynamic dataflow analysis?
    - Why not, and if there is some `TypeError` with certain types, I can change some parameters of the same types and see
      the impact

- Abstract
    - Despite popular usage, most of the dynamically typed languages still lack automated test data generation tools.
      Most of the existing tools and approaches depend critically on static and explicit types, which makes it hard to
      port any of them over to dynamically typed languages. In this paper we present a search-based test data generation
      tool, NAME, which focuses on primitive types and lists of Python. NAME not only searches for test input values but
      also for appropriate types for each input argument. We evaluate NAME based on the structural coverage it achieves,
      the cost of the type search, and the overhead for the execution of the function under test. We further discuss the
      future of automated testing for dynamic and object-oriented languages based on our experience.

- can't subclass `bool` and `None` (can be the same for a user defined class)
{{{python
def wrapper_custom_type(type_name, *, position=None):
    def new_instance(*args):
        if type_name == bool:
            class CustomType():
                def __init__(self):
                    self.__name__ = bool
        else:
            class CustomType(type_name):
                def __init__(self, *argss):
                    super().__init__(*argss)
                    self.ident = position
                    self.__name__ = type_name
        return CustomType(*args)
    return new_instance
}}}
{{{python
>>> b = custom_types.wrapper_custom_type(bool, position=3)()
>>> type(b)
<class 'custom_types.wrapper_custom_type.<locals>.new_instance.<locals>.CustomType'>
>>> isinstance(b, bool)
False
>>> a = custom_types.wrapper_custom_type(int, position=3)()
>>> a
0
>>> type(a)
<class 'custom_types.wrapper_custom_type.<locals>.new_instance.<locals>.CustomType'>
>>>
>>> isinstance(a, int)
True
}}}
- `bool` is subclass of `int`
{{{python
>>> inspect.getmro(bool)
(<class 'bool'>, <class 'int'>, <class 'object'>)
>>> inspect.getmro(type(None))
(<class 'NoneType'>, <class 'object'>)
}}}
- can't add information to all exceptions
- ~~*no way to know which object is the source of type error*~~
- ~~*change name of class*~~

- Seminar (정주)
    - On the correlation between size and metric validity
    - Size has strong correlation with other metrics
- Seminar (성민)
    - Data-driven Approach, k-Nearest Neighbor, train/val/test splits

- use [[https://github.com/clarete/forbiddenfruit|forbiddenfruit]] which means the project is limited to CPython
    - still can't modify type of... type, what I want to do is modify the base exception but seems unfeasable?

== Blocking Points ==
%% - ~~Returns~~ Exits in switch cases in function calls
%%     - underlying problem, one `if` for multiple cases
%% {{{c
%% switch (a) {
%%     case 1: huge_problem();
%%     case 2: break;
%% }}}
- ~~Instrumenting `for`~~
    - ~~handle `in` comparator~~ instrumented iterator
- Instrumenting `is`
    - Does it make sense? because it's testing UID
- Is TypeError a real bug or are we using the wrong type?
- TypeError during type AVM
    - redo all branches?
{{{python
def test(a):
    if a:
        a + 1
}}}
- Using floats instead of ints means that we need a way to have exact values for floats

- [[https://github.com/Qix-/better-exceptions|better_exceptions]] (just for printing?) (also similar [[https://github.com/skorokithakis/tbvaccine/|tbvaccine]])

- you can only access variables from frames of function call


== Planned work ==
- [.] Instrument Python code
    - [ ] Other comparators handled: Is | ~~IsNot~~ | In | ~~NotIn~~
        - does instrumenting `is` makes sense for other than `None`?
        - no distance for `is` or `in`
    - [ ] Other boolean like `__notzero__`
    - [X] Branching handled
        - [X] `while`
            - [X] `while`
            - [X] `else`
        - [X] `for`
            - [X] `for` ~~(add decorator to `__iter__` [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1420484/how-can-i-add-a-decorator-to-an-existing-object-method]]?)~~ iterator wrapping the original
            - [X] `else`
            %% - [ ] `AsyncFor`
            - simple `if` on wether a `StopIteration` is raised, no distance

- [.] Convert the global tool for Python
    - [ ] find a better way for `Process` sandbox, a virgin process is enough but maybe not possible because of shared
          queue
    - [ ] divide at some point for `float`
        - or see it the other way around, use `int` only and then divide if needed
    - [o] lists
        - [X] param indexing with depth
        - [X] recursive search
        - [ ] implement it in the type search
        - assumes there is a first element
            - in the search, try there for the empty list?
    - [X] changed from passing around the elem to passing around the index, but now I can't access elements in lists
        - [X] use a tuple of indexes
        - [X] subclass of `list` for individual.vector to accept tuple of indexes
    - [ ] positive integers
    - [ ] Type inference in AVM
        - again you can't be sure of which parameter is the source
        - the idea is to detect stuff like idexing

- [.] AVM to find correct type of python function
    - [X] Make it possible for cavm to execute the python function
    - [ ] More than just types, e.g. a negative integer
    - [ ] primitive types: ~~*bool*~~, numeric (~~*int*~~, ~~*float*~~, complex), iterator, sequence (*list*, tuple, range), ~~*str*~~, binary
          sequence (bytes, bytearray, memoryview), set (set, frozenset), dict, context manager
          other built-in types: modules, classes, functions, methods, ...
        - ignore 'Truth Value Testing'?
        - keep a list of tested types for each param?
    - [ ] Get information from TypeError
    - [ ] Floats seem to stay between 0 and 1
    - [ ] try False and True to avoid problems with e.g. empty list
    - [ ] try [] and with an element to know the type of the list, for now we'll put always the same type in lists
        - an error can occur after because of the size being too small
    - [ ] `TypeError` detection after
    - [ ] method decorator to detect which parameter is at cause

- [X] CAVM `switch` `default` `if`, the False branch will never be taken thus wasting computing
    - underlying problem, one `if` for multiple cases
- [ ] ~~Better integration of the first round for code generation for `switch` in CAVM~~
    - ~~Better file names~~

- [ ] Read the code of RuTeG
- [ ] Read about GodelTest

- [X] Submit abstract (2017-06-30 Fri) [[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ensrennesditm12017]]

- [ ] Static analysis of dynamically typed languages
